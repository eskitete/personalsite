## What Indexes Do

Indexes act like the table of contents in a book. They let the database engine jump directly to relevant rows instead of scanning every record. By organizing column values in B-trees or hash structures, indexes **dramatically speed up** queries that filter or sort on those columns. The trade-off: indexes consume storage and make writes slightly slower because the database must update both the table and its indexes.

## Choose Columns Strategically

Start by examining workload patterns:

- Columns referenced in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` statements benefit most.  
- Composite indexes cover multi-column filters, but **order matters**—the database can only use leading columns efficiently.  
- Covering indexes include every column referenced in a query so the engine can satisfy the request without touching the base table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_status
  ON orders (customer_id, status, created_at);
```

## Guard Against Index Bloat

Database engines expose metadata about index usage. Review it periodically to answer:

- Which indexes are frequently scanned?  
- Which ones never get touched and waste I/O?  
- Are there slow queries hinting at missing indexes?

Drop unused indexes and add new ones based on evidence—not guesswork.

## Explore Advanced Options

Specialized indexes extend performance tuning:

- **Partial / filtered indexes** cover only the rows that matter (e.g., open orders).  
- **Functional indexes** store computed expressions for case-insensitive search or JSON fields.  
- **Unique indexes** enforce data quality rules right in the database.

By understanding how indexes work and measuring their impact, you can strike the right balance between read performance and write throughput.
