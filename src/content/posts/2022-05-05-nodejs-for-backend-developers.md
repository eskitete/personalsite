## One Language, Front to Back

Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript on the server, unifying front-end and back-end development with a single language. Built on the V8 engine, Node executes JavaScript quickly while providing a **non-blocking event loop** that shines for I/O-heavy tasks—serving APIs, streaming data, or orchestrating microservices. npm’s enormous ecosystem accelerates development with battle-tested packages.

## Frameworks That Fit Your Style

- **Express.js** offers routing, middleware, and minimal abstractions—perfect when you want full control.  
- **Fastify** brings speed and a plugin system with schema-based validation.  
- **NestJS** layers on dependency injection and familiar patterns for developers coming from Java or .NET.

Whichever framework you choose, lean on `async`/`await` for readable asynchronous code instead of callback pyramids.

## Ship for Production

Hardening a Node service means investing beyond business logic:

1. **Process managers** like PM2 or container orchestrators restart apps automatically.  
2. **Clustering** spreads work across CPU cores to handle higher throughput.  
3. **Structured logging** plus metrics and tracing help find bottlenecks quickly.  
4. **Security hygiene**—input validation, output encoding, dependency patching—blocks common exploits.

> Monitor event loop lag. Spikes often signal expensive synchronous work that should be offloaded.

## Share Code Across the Stack

JavaScript on both client and server encourages reuse. Share validation schemas, data models, and utility functions to keep contracts aligned and reduce duplication. As organizations adopt microservices and serverless architectures, Node.js remains a popular choice thanks to its lightweight runtime and thriving community support.
