## Measure First

Fast websites keep users engaged and directly influence revenue, conversion rates, and search rankings. When a page feels sluggish, people bounce before reading the content. Start with measurement tools such as **Lighthouse**, **WebPageTest**, and the **Core Web Vitals** dashboard to pinpoint where time is spent. Focus on metrics users actually feel:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** — how quickly the main content appears  
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)** — how long JavaScript blocks user input  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** — how much the layout jumps during load

## Shorten the Critical Path

Reducing the path to first render delivers outsized wins:

1. Minimize render-blocking CSS and JavaScript.  
2. Preload fonts and hero images that guarantee a quick first paint.  
3. Inline only the essential styles and defer the rest.  
4. Use code splitting so users download **just** the scripts needed for the current view.  
5. Compress assets with Brotli or gzip and serve images as WebP or AVIF.

### Pro tip

> Every kilobyte counts on cellular networks. Audit bundle size whenever you ship new features.

## Cache Aggressively

Caching multiplies the returns on optimization work:

- Set `cache-control` headers so browsers and CDNs can reuse responses.  
- Leverage service workers to precache shell assets and enable offline support.  
- Push frequently accessed data closer to users with edge caches or KV stores.  
- For personalized experiences, vary cache keys by the user attributes that matter.

## Make Performance a Habit

Performance is a culture, not a sprint. Bake it into your workflow by:

- Defining performance budgets and failing CI builds that exceed them.  
- Watching real-user monitoring (RUM) to see how changes behave on actual devices.  
- Testing on low-powered phones or throttled connections during QA.  
- Reviewing metrics after every release.

Continuous measurement and iteration keep experiences fast even as the product evolves.
