## Understand the Shared Responsibility Model

Moving workloads to the cloud introduces a shared responsibility for security. Providers secure the underlying infrastructure—physical hardware, networking, and hypervisors—while you safeguard the **applications**, **data**, and **access controls** you deploy. Misconfigurations remain the number one cause of breaches, so invest time in learning each cloud provider’s security tooling.

## Build Strong Identity Foundations

Identity and access management (IAM) sits at the center of cloud security. Adopt these best practices:

- **Role-based access control** to keep permissions aligned with responsibilities.  
- **Single sign-on** and centralized identity providers to simplify offboarding.  
- **Multi-factor authentication** for all privileged accounts.  
- **Just-in-time access** where high-risk permissions expire automatically.

> Least privilege is a living process. Review roles quarterly to catch privilege creep.

## Encrypt Everywhere

Encryption at rest and in transit is non-negotiable:

- Managed key services such as AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault automate rotation, auditing, and policy enforcement.  
- Hardware security modules (HSMs) protect sensitive keys with tamper-resistant hardware.  
- Enforce TLS for every public endpoint and consider mutual TLS for internal services.

## Maintain Visibility and Response

Security tools only matter if you can see what’s happening:

- Stream logs to centralized storage and monitor with alerting rules.  
- Enable cloud-native threat detection services to surface anomalies quickly.  
- Use security posture management to continuously scan for misconfigurations.  
- Run compliance assessments and penetration tests to validate assumptions.

Automation closes the loop. Trigger remediation workflows when violations occur so you can confidently operate in the cloud while keeping data secure.
