## Design for Every Screen

Users visit websites from phones, tablets, laptops, and ultra-wide monitors. Responsive design embraces **fluid layouts**, **flexible media**, and **adaptive breakpoints** so experiences feel natural everywhere. Instead of fixed pixel widths, rely on percentages, min/max constraints, and modern layout systems like Flexbox and CSS Grid to rearrange content automatically.

## Start Mobile-First

Begin with the smallest screen to make sure the essentials shine:

1. Prioritize core content and actions.  
2. Choose typography that is legible without zooming.  
3. Keep navigation simple—think bottom tabs or hamburger menus.

As the viewport expands, layer on enhancements such as multi-column layouts, larger imagery, and additional UI details. Progressive enhancement keeps the experience fast for everyone.

## Tune Typography and Media

- Use relative units (`rem`, `em`, `vw`) so text scales with user preferences.  
- Aim for readable line lengths (45–75 characters) and comfortable line height.  
- Serve responsive images with the `srcset` attribute and enable lazy loading.  
- Reserve space for media to prevent layout shifts.

> Test the experience with browser zoom and OS-level text scaling—accessibility wins double as responsive wins.

## Test Like a User

Browser devtools give you quick device emulation, but nothing beats real hardware. Validate touch targets, gestures, and orientation changes on phones and tablets. Iterate with responsiveness in mind and you’ll craft interfaces that feel tailored to every visitor—not optimized for a single screen size.
