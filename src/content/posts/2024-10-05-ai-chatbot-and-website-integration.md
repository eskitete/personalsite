## The Challenge

Local service businesses needed a way to capture leads 24/7 and hand prospects off to internal teams without wrestling with code-heavy solutions. Existing tools were either too rigid or too expensive.

## The Solution

I designed a modular automation stack that combines **n8n**, **Make.com**, and lightweight custom scripts:

- Chat widgets built in React mount on any website and sync branding automatically.  
- Conversations pipe into n8n workflows, where context is persisted and enriched with OpenAI classification.  
- Qualified leads flow into a CRM-ready format and trigger automated follow-ups.  
- I exposed a self-service dashboard so clients can adjust prompts, hours of operation, and escalation rules.

> By choosing low-code automation tooling, I gave clients the power to tweak their funnel without redeploying the entire app.

## Results

Clients reported a 30â€“40% increase in captured leads within the first month. The system continues to run in production, and the architecture now serves as a template for new verticals such as legal services and home maintenance.
