## Snapshots That Tell a Story

Git is the backbone of collaborative software development. It stores snapshots of your project history, linking them together through commits. Each commit records **who**, **what**, and **why**, creating an audit trail that simplifies debugging, accountability, and knowledge sharing.

## Branching Strategies That Scale

Branching is Git’s superpower:

- Feature branches isolate work-in-progress from the main branch.  
- Pull requests invite discussion, automated testing, and review before merging.  
- Strategies like **Git Flow** or **trunk-based development** document how teams coordinate releases and hotfixes.

## Tools That Level Up Your Workflow

- **Interactive rebase** keeps history clean and easy to follow.  
- **Cherry-pick** moves specific commits across branches when you need them elsewhere.  
- **Git stash** temporarily hides uncommitted work.  
- **Git bisect** binary-searches history to find the commit that introduced a regression.

> Pro tip: Rebase *before* opening a pull request to give reviewers a crisp, linear history.

## Keep the Repo Healthy

Establish conventions early and stick to them:

1. Write meaningful commit messages that tell future readers what changed.  
2. Document your branching model so onboarding developers know what to expect.  
3. Automate linting, tests, and formatting in CI pipelines triggered by pull requests.

With disciplined practices, Git becomes more than version control—it becomes the foundation for delivering software quickly without sacrificing stability.
