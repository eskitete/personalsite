## Why OAuth Exists

APIs power modern applications, enabling native apps, web frontends, and third-party integrations to exchange data securely. OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for **delegating access without sharing passwords**. Instead of handing over credentials, a client obtains an access token scoped to specific permissions. Resource servers validate the token before serving data, ensuring only authorized requests reach protected endpoints.

## Pick the Right Flow

Different application types call for different grant types:

| Grant Type             | Best For                               | Highlights |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Authorization Code** | Web apps & single-page apps (with PKCE)| Secure redirect flow with user consent |
| **Client Credentials** | Machine-to-machine integrations        | No user context, pure service auth     |
| **Device Code**        | Devices without browsers or keyboards  | Polling + user confirmation            |
| **Refresh Tokens**     | Long-lived sessions                    | Rotate access tokens without re-login  |

> Public clients (mobile or SPA) should always pair Authorization Code with **PKCE** to protect against interception.

## Harden the Implementation

- **Exact redirect URIs** prevent attackers from injecting their own endpoints.  
- **Short-lived access tokens** limit exposure if they leak.  
- **Secure storage** (HTTP-only cookies or encrypted keychains) keeps tokens out of reach from scripts.  
- **Scope design** keeps the blast radius minimalâ€”grant the least access required for the job.

## Lean on Gateways and Monitoring

Identity providers and API gateways take the heavy lifting off your hands. They handle consent screens, scope management, token introspection, and revocation. Still, you should:

- Log authentication and authorization events.  
- Alert on unusual patterns such as repeated token failures or access spikes.  
- Regularly rotate credentials and review third-party integrations.

Embracing OAuth gives teams a scalable blueprint for secure API access while preserving user trust.
