## Embrace the REST Mindset

REST (Representational State Transfer) offers a simple, scalable architectural style for APIs. Leverage the standard HTTP verbs—`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`—and design resource-oriented URLs that mirror your business domain. When clients can guess endpoints, documentation becomes lighter and integration smoother.

## Consistency Builds Trust

- Return the right **status codes** for each outcome (e.g., `201 Created`, `404 Not Found`).  
- Provide descriptive error messages with machine-readable details.  
- Keep JSON payloads predictable; stable shapes make clients resilient.  
- Include pagination metadata or hypermedia links to guide clients through collections.  
- Ensure `PUT` and `DELETE` remain idempotent so retries never cause surprises.

> A well-behaved API lets clients retry safely—design for flaky networks from day one.

## Secure and Validate Every Request

1. Validate input at the boundary to drop malformed or malicious requests.  
2. Authenticate callers (JWT, OAuth, API keys) and authorize them with fine-grained scopes.  
3. Throttle and rate-limit to prevent a single client from overwhelming the service.  
4. Log requests with correlation IDs so you can trace a call across distributed systems.

## Document and Test Contracts

- Publish an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification to power interactive docs and SDK generation.  
- Use contract tests to guarantee changes stay backward compatible.  
- Integrate automated testing and linting into CI/CD pipelines so regressions are caught before production.

Following these practices keeps RESTful APIs reliable as they evolve, while providing a developer experience your consumers will love.
