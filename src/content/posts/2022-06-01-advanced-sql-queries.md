## Beyond the Basic SELECT

Once you master everyday `SELECT` statements, advanced SQL techniques unlock powerful transformations. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** break complex queries into readable chunks and enable recursive logic for hierarchical data or sequential calculations. **Window functions** compute running totals, rankings, and moving averages without collapsing rows—perfect for analytics dashboards.

### Window Function Example

```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  order_total,
  SUM(order_total) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY created_at) AS running_total
FROM orders;
```

## Reshape Data Efficiently

- **Pivot** rows into columns to produce cross-tab reports directly in SQL.  
- **Unpivot** wide tables to normalize data before analysis.  
- **Conditional aggregation** with `CASE` inside aggregates delivers metrics in a single pass.

These techniques minimize round trips to the database and reduce the need for post-processing code.

## Keep Performance Front and Center

As queries grow complex:

1. Analyze execution plans to understand join order and index usage.  
2. Ensure supporting indexes exist for filters and join keys.  
3. Watch for full table scans or sorts that balloon runtime.  
4. Consider materialized views or temporary tables to pre-compute expensive steps.

## Practice Makes It Intuitive

Experiment on real datasets—public data, anonymized production snapshots, or synthetic loads. The more you iterate, the sharper your intuition becomes for when each tool is appropriate. Well-crafted SQL empowers teams to answer nuanced questions quickly and accurately, driving smarter decisions across the organization.
