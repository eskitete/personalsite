## Hackers on Your Side

Ethical hacking uses the same techniques as malicious attackers—but with permission and a clear purpose: uncover vulnerabilities before adversaries do. Engagements begin with detailed **scoping documents** that define systems in-bounds, allowed testing methods, and reporting expectations. This transparency protects both the tester and the organization while focusing efforts on high-value targets.

## Reconnaissance: Know the Terrain

Recon collects information about the environment:

- **Passive recon** gathers public intel—domain records, leaked credentials, exposed services.  
- **Active recon** probes systems directly to map open ports, running software, and potential entry points.

The goal is to build a rich picture of the attack surface without causing disruption.

## Exploitation With Restraint

Once weaknesses emerge, ethical hackers carefully test exploitation. They may chain multiple issues—like a misconfigured cloud bucket plus leaked credentials—to demonstrate real-world impact. Every step is documented meticulously:

```text
Exploit: SSRF via /api/proxy
Impact: Access to internal metadata service -> credential theft
Remediation: Validate outbound destinations, block instance metadata
```

Responsible hackers stop short of causing damage, prioritizing proof-of-concept evidence over production impact.

## Deliver Actionable Reports

The engagement wraps with a comprehensive report that:

1. Ranks vulnerabilities by severity and likelihood.  
2. Explains how each was discovered, replicable steps included.  
3. Provides clear remediation guidance with owner suggestions.

Many organizations supplement assessments with continuous monitoring, bug bounty programs, and red-team exercises to keep defenses sharp. By embracing ethical hacking, security teams gain an informed perspective on their risk posture and a practical roadmap for improvement.
