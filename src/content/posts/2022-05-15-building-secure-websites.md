## Encrypt the Transport Layer

Web security blends secure coding, hardened infrastructure, and vigilant monitoring. Start by enforcing **HTTPS everywhere** to protect data in transit. Services like Let’s Encrypt automate certificate issuance, while HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) keeps browsers from downgrading to insecure connections. Combine that with modern TLS configurations to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

## Write Defensive Code

- Sanitize user input to block SQL injection and cross-site scripting.  
- Encode output so user-generated content renders safely in the browser.  
- Deploy a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to limit which domains can load scripts, styles, and media.  
- Configure SameSite cookies and robust session management to minimize CSRF attacks.

> Never rely on client-side validation alone—always validate on the server.

## Harden Authentication and Authorization

1. Hash passwords using modern algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt.  
2. Require multi-factor authentication for privileged accounts.  
3. Implement role-based access control with feature-level permissions.  
4. Capture audit logs for critical actions to support investigations.

## Continuously Improve

Security is an ongoing discipline. Stay ahead of emerging threats by:

- Running dependency audits and applying patches promptly.  
- Scheduling vulnerability scans and penetration tests.  
- Automating security tests in CI/CD pipelines.  
- Operating bug bounty or responsible disclosure programs.

Treat security as a core product feature—not an afterthought—and you’ll earn user trust that lasts.
