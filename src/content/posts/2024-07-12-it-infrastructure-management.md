## Modernizing the Stack

An educational network was juggling legacy Windows servers, manual onboarding, and inconsistent security policies. I led a modernization initiative focused on automation, centralized identity, and resilient monitoring.

## Key Upgrades

- Migrated identity to **Azure Active Directory**, enabling single sign-on across labs and staff devices.  
- Automated device provisioning with Intune, drastically reducing setup time for new semesters.  
- Hardened Windows environments with group policy baselines, conditional access, and routine compliance scans.  
- Implemented network segmentation and logging so the IT team can trace issues instantly.

## Lessons Learned

Working within tight academic schedules taught me to plan migrations around class calendars and communicate deployments with non-technical stakeholders. The district now enjoys predictable maintenance windows, happier faculty, and a security posture that finally keeps pace with modern threats.
