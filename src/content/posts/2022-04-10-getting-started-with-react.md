## Why React Changed Frontend Development

React popularized a **component-based model** paired with declarative rendering. Instead of manually manipulating the DOM, you describe how the interface should look for a given state and React takes care of syncing the DOM efficiently. This mental shift mirrors how designers think about UI—reusable pieces composed into larger views.

## Core Building Blocks

- **Components** return JSX to describe the UI.  
- **Props** pass data from parent to child.  
- **State** stores mutable data that triggers a re-render.

Hooks make state and side-effects composable:

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]);
```

As apps grow, reach for `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and custom hooks to share logic and keep components fast.

## Level Up Your Toolkit

A rich ecosystem makes React productive:

- **Vite** or **Create React App** for hot reload and TypeScript support.  
- **React Router** for client-side navigation.  
- **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** for state management when props no longer scale.  
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching and caching.  
- UI kits like **Tailwind UI**, **Chakra UI**, or **shadcn/ui** for accessible components.

> Start with as few abstractions as possible. Add libraries when you clearly feel the pain they solve.

## Practice to Master

Learning React is a hands-on journey:

1. Build small components to internalize JSX and state.  
2. Add interactivity—forms, API calls, and routing.  
3. Adopt TypeScript early to document props and catch bugs.  
4. Refine code with tests, performance profiling, and accessibility checks.

The more projects you ship, the more instinctive React’s model becomes—setting you up to tackle full-scale applications confidently.
